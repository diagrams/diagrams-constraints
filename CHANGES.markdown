0.0.1: 8/7/2014
---------------------

First release, from Mathnerd314's GSOC. 

Basically just some skeleton files from diagrams-svg and cmear's example ported to sbv.

Features still not implemented:
- drawing
- any API at all

This is alpha-stage so don't expect anything to work beyond that advertised in the README.
